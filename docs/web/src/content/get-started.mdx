# Get Started

You can just start using Gormite with the following commands:

## Quick start with Goose

You can start by configuring your own Gormite binary.

## Create manually

Gormite works as an external utility, so it doesn't need to plug into `go.mod`,
and it accepts configs to read mappings from it. To start: [^3]

<Steps>
### Install Gormite [^1]

```sh copy
go install github.com/KoNekoD/gormite/cmd/gormite@latest
```

### Create a `gormite.yaml` config file under the resources directory [^2]

```yaml copy filename="resources/gormite.yaml"
gormite:
  orm:
    mapping:
      Entities:
        dir: pkg/entities
```

### Create your first entity `user.go` file for migration generation

```go copy filename="pkg/entities/user.go"
package entities

import "github.com/KoNekoD/gormite/test/docs_example/pkg/enums"

// Entities can have custom table names
//      \/

// User "app_user"
type User struct {
	ID           int                `db:"id" pk:"true"`
	Email        string             `db:"email" uniq:"email" length:"180" uniq_cond:"email:(identity_type = 'email')"`
	Phone        string             `db:"phone" uniq:"phone" length:"10" uniq_cond:"phone:(identity_type = 'phone')"`
	IdentityType enums.IdentityType `db:"identity_type" type:"varchar"`
	Code         *string            `db:"code" nullable:"true"`
	FullName     *string            `db:"full_name" default:"'Anonymous'" index:"index_full_name" index_cond:"index_full_name:(is_active = true)"`
	IsActive     bool               `db:"is_active"`
}

type UserProfile struct {
	ID   int   `db:"id" pk:"true"`
	User *User `db:"user_id"`
	Age  int   `db:"age"`
}
```

gormite -t goose --dsn "$DATABASE_DSN"
```
